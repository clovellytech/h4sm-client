H4SM PureScript Client
---

This aims to provide a complete client interface for the [H4SM modules](https://github.com/clovellytech/h4sm.git). It's up to date for version v0.0.8. Versioning for this client will track identically with the H4SM project.

Each module from H4SM has a separate client implementation in this project, so you should be able to mirror your client dependencies with your server dependencies and reuse client modules in the same way as server modules.

## Todo
* Create admin client
* Create features client
* Create files client
